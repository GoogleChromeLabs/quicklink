## Debugging Quicklink

The [test
folder](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink/tree/master/test) contains
several test cases. Make sure to create a new test when building a new feature.

Here's an example of how to debug the library by using one of these tests:
[test/test-basic-usage.html](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink/blob/master/test/test-basic-usage.html).

1. Comment the following block of code at `test/test-basic-usage.html`:

```javascript
<script src="../dist/quicklink.umd.js"></script>
  <script>
    quicklink.listen();
  </script>
```

2. Add the following snippet in its place, to import the module from its
   source file:

```javascript
<script type="module"> 
    import { listen } from "../src/index.mjs"; 
    listen(); 
</script>
```

3. Open
   [src/index.mjs](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink/blob/master/src/index.mjs)
   for edit and replace the following line: 
   
```javascript
import throttle from 'throttles';
``` 

By:
   
```javascript
import throttle from '../node_modules/throttles/dist/index.mjs'
```

4. Build the project: `npm run build`.

5. Start a local server: `npm run start`. By default, this will start the local server at `https://localhost:8080`.

6. Open the file where the modifications where made:
   `http://localhost:8080/test/test-basic-usage.html`.

7. Open Chrome DevTools and go the **Sources** tab.

8. Under `localhost:8080/src` you can find the unminified versions of the `Quicklink` files.
   Now you can use breakpoints and inspect variables to debug the library.
