## Demos

This page contains some demo sites that use Quicklink to improve navigation, grouped by architecture: **Multi Page Apps** / **Single Page Apps**.

If you like the library, and want to try them on your site, check out the **Installation** section of the [home page](/).

#### Multi Page Apps

In this demo youâ€™ll compare an ecommerce site with and without Quicklink to see how navigation is improved thanks to the library.

The following waterfall shows a typical navigation for a site without Quicklink (top) vs. the same site using the library (bottom):

{% endmarkdownConvert %}

{% markdownConvert %}

To try the demo:

1. Open the [unoptimized site](https://mini-ecomm.glitch.me/) in Chrome.
1. Open **DevTools** and go to the **Network panel** to simulate a **Fast 3G** Connection.
1. Pick **Galaxy S5** as a simulated device.
1. Make sure **Disable cache** is not checked.
1. Reload the page.

{% endmarkdownConvert %}

<img loading="lazy" class="article-image" src="/assets/images/screenshots/devtools-unoptimized.png" height="130" width="600" alt="Image shows chrome dev tools inspection for site not using quicklink">

{% markdownConvert %}

Now, measure performance on the same site, that uses Quicklink:

1. Open the [optimized site](https://mini-ecomm-quicklink.glitch.me/) in Chrome.
1. Open **DevTools** and go to the **Network panel** to simulate a **Fast 3G** Connection.
1. Pick **Galaxy S5** as a simulated device.
1. Make sure **Disable cache** is not checked.
1. Reload the page.

Prefetched links can be identified in the **Network** panel by having `quicklink` as the **Initiator** and **Lowest** as the **Priority**:

{% endmarkdownConvert %}

<img loading="lazy" class="article-image" src="/assets/images/screenshots/devtools-optimized-1.png" height="130" width="600" alt="Image shows chrome dev tools inspection for site using quicklink">

{% markdownConvert %}

To measure the impact of `quicklink` on navigations:

1. Clear the **Network** trace.
1. Click on a list item.
1. Take a look at the **Network** panel.

{% endmarkdownConvert %}

<img loading="lazy" class="article-image" src="/assets/images/screenshots/devtools-optimized-2.png" height="130" width="600" alt="Image shows the site using quicklink along with prefetch cache improves data fetching time by 97 percent">

{% markdownConvert %}

In the **Size** column of the **Network** panel the trace shows that the product page was retrieved from the **prefetch cache** and now takes **3ms** to load: a **97% improvement** compared to the unoptimized version.

Here is a comparison video:

{% endmarkdownConvert %}

{% markdownConvert %}

### Single Page Apps

Quicklink 2.0 includes support for React-based single-page-apps. This has been covered to the detail in this [guide](https://web.dev/quicklink/).

To try the demo:

1. Open the [optimized site](https://create-react-app-quicklink.glitch.me/) in Chrome.
1. Open DevTools and go to the **Network** panel to simulate a **Fast 3G** Connection.
1. Pick **Galaxy S5** as a simulated device.
1. Make sure **Disable cache** is not checked.
1. Reload the page.

When the home page loads the chunks for that route are loaded. After that, `quicklink` prefetches the route's chunks for the in-viewport links:

{% endmarkdownConvert %}

<img loading="lazy" class="article-image" src="/assets/images/screenshots/spa-devtools-optimized-1.png" height="204" width="570" alt="Image shows that data for loading links available on the page being viewed are loaded beforehand by quicklink">

{% markdownConvert %}

Next:

1. Clear the **Network** log again.
1. Make sure **Disable** cache is not checked.
1. Click the Blog link to navigate to that page.

{% endmarkdownConvert %}

<img loading="lazy" class="article-image" src="/assets/images/screenshots/spa-devtools-optimized-2.png" height="76" width="643" alt="Image shows that quicklink takes only 2 milliseconds to load a site using prefetch cache">

{% markdownConvert %}

The Size column indicates that these chunks were retrieved from the "prefetch cache", instead of the network. Loading these chunks without a Quicklink takes approximately 580ms. Using the library it takes 2ms, which represents a 99% reduction!
